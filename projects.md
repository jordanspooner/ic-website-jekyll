# Selection of Academic and Personal Projects

## Codet
***May - Jun 2018***

Runner-up for the IBM Project Prize.

Codet is a a fully-customisable, gamified web-app that engages kids aged 9-15 and teaches them JavaScript through fun projects such as building games. It was developed iteratively, based on feedback, to continuously deliver an improved experience to users. The API was built using Node.js and MongoDB and the front-end uses Vue.js. Submitted as part of the WebApps project at Imperial.

See an [overview](assets/codet/codet.pdf) and our [final presentation](assets/codet/codet-tech.pdf).

## Pintos
***Jan - Mar 2018***

Submitted as part of the second year labs at Imperial, for which I was awarded the Olav Beckmann Project Prize.

## MeSSHenger
***Feb 2018***

This project was built individually in under 24 hours for ICHack 18.

## Advlang
***Jan 2018***

This project was built in under 24 hours for Hack Cambridge 2018.

## WACC Compiler
***Oct - Dec 2017***

Submitted as part of the second year labs at Imperial, for which I was awarded the Olav Beckmann Project Prize.

## BoomBox
***Oct 2017***

[BoomBox](https://devpost.com/software/boombox-s7zmce) is an award-winning web application that allows users to form a distributed speaker system. Users can vote for songs to be played from YouTube, and act as a speaker for the group. The sound is perfectly synchronised between all users. The back-end is built with Node.js and MongoDB, and the front-end uses Vue.js.

This project was built in under 24 hours for Porticode 2017.

## Phishing Website Classifier
***Jul 2017***

A classifier using a combination of machine learning algorithms, able to correctly classify over 99% of URLs submitted to Netcraft. This makes it extremely competitive, compared to results from academia.

The project is currently in use to classify the very hardest URLs sent to Netcraft, that would otherwise have to be checked manually. It represents a significant improvement on previously deployed classifiers at Netcraft, saving a large amount of manual effort.

## OpenCV Game Engine
***Jun 2017***

Awarded ARM Best Overall Project Prize.

An ARM11 emulator and assembler, and a fully-documented and tested [game engine](https://github.com/ic-projects/opencv-game-engine) that uses the OpenCV computer vision library for motion-controlled games using a webcam. Submitted as part of the ARM11 project at Imperial.

## Kiitos
***Apr 2017***

[Kiitos](https://devpost.com/software/kiitos) is a web application that makes donating to charity easy and transparent, by using Ethereum. It uses a Solidity smart contract, that allows you to donate in set proportions to multiple charities. It also allows the creator to set a percentage of donations to match. For a charity to receive their donations, they just need to be able to prove that they control their website. The front end was built using Node.js.

This project was built in under 24 hours for MLHPrime 17.

## Autoencoders and their Applications
***Jan 2017 - Mar 2017***

A [website](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~js4416/163/website/) presenting autoencoders and their applications, submitted as part of the Computing Topics project at Imperial. My personal area of research was the applications of autoencoders in natural language processing.

## WEther
***Feb 2017***

Awarded WarwickHack prize for most disruptive hack.

[WEther](https://devpost.com/software/weather-g8lp3r) is an Ethereum-based weather insurance application. It uses a Solidity smart contract and a Haskell API to set up an insurance contract on the blockchain for a certain date and location, calculating a fair payout. It uses Oraclize to check the final weather conditions, and determine if the payout should be awarded. The front-end was built using Meteor.js.

This project was built in under 24 hours for WarwickHack 17.

## Emojifier
***Jan 2017***

[Emojifier](https://devpost.com/software/emojifier) uses word embeddings and recurrent neural networks to choose relevant emojis, and add them to a block of text. The back-end was built in Python (including some TensorFlow), and the front-end was built using Node.js.

This project was built in under 24 hours for ICHack 17.
